    "## 1. Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **agent-as-tool** pattern is the simplest and most portable way to compose multiple agents.\n",
    "Each specialist sub-agent is wrapped in a Python function and attached to the manager agent\n",
    "as a regular tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer query\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       ▼\n",
    "  Manager Agent  ──reads docstrings──▶  picks tool to call\n",
    "       │\n",
    "       ├──▶ handle_order_query()   ──▶  OrderAgent   (orders, returns, shipping)\n",
    "       ├──▶ handle_product_query() ──▶  ProductAgent  (specs, availability, recommendations)\n",
    "       └──▶ handle_billing_query() ──▶  BillingAgent  (payments, refunds, invoices)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this pattern works:**\n",
    "- Each sub-agent has a focused role → better, more accurate answers\n",
    "- The manager never needs to know the implementation details of each specialist\n",
    "- The docstring on each wrapper function is what guides the manager's routing decision\n",
    "- Adding a new specialist = create agent + write wrapper function + `manager.add_tool(fn)` — nothing else changes"

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent-as-tool** = wrap `sub_agent.run(query)` in a Python function, attach to manager with `add_tool()`\n",
    "- The **docstring on each wrapper** is the routing logic — make it precise with examples and exclusions\n",
    "- The manager needs `instructions` that enforce tool-first routing (never answer from knowledge)\n",
    "- For multi-domain queries, the manager automatically calls multiple tools and synthesizes the result\n",
    "- Adding a new specialist: create agent + write wrapper + `manager.add_tool(fn)` — nothing else changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Reference\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Create sub-agents\n",
    "specialist = studio.create_agent(name=\"...\", provider=\"openai/gpt-4o\", role=\"...\", ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Wrap as tool\n",
    "def handle_specialist_query(query: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Specific docstring describing what queries this handles.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return specialist.run(query).response\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Add to manager\n",
    "manager.add_tool(handle_specialist_query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Run — manager routes automatically\n",
    "response = manager.run(\"customer message\")\n",
