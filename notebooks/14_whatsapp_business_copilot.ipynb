    "| Agent | `studio.create_agent()` with customer service role |\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use `session_id=customer_phone` — this is the unique identifier for each WhatsApp thread\n",
    "- The agent-as-webhook pattern is: receive message → `agent.run(text, session_id=phone)` → tool sends reply\n",
    "- Any business logic (order lookup, CRM queries, inventory checks) becomes a tool with a clear docstring\n",
    "- Keep WhatsApp replies under 300 characters — set this expectation in `instructions`\n",
    "- Simulation mode (print instead of call Meta) lets you develop and test without credentials\n",
