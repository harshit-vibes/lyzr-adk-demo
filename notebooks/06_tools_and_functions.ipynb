    "|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| Write a clear, specific docstring | The agent reads this to decide when and how to call the tool |\n",
    "| Add type annotations to parameters | Helps the agent extract and pass the correct data types |\n",

    "\n",
    "- Any Python function can become an agent tool — attach it with `agent.add_tool(fn)`.\n",
    "- The **docstring** is what the agent reads to decide when to call the tool. A missing or vague docstring means the tool will be ignored.\n",
    "- **Type annotations** on parameters guide the agent to extract and pass the right data.\n",
    "- Agents can hold **multiple tools** and will automatically select the most appropriate one per request.\n",
    "- The tool-calling flow is fully automatic: the agent decides, calls, and incorporates the result — you just write the function."
