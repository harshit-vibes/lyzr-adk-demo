    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Production agents need safety layers. Lyzr's Responsible AI (RAI) system lets you add guardrails that check every message **before it reaches the LLM** and every response **before it reaches the user** — preventing harmful content, protecting user privacy, and keeping agents on-topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAI sits as a middleware layer in the request/response pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Message → [RAI Input Check] → LLM → [RAI Output Check] → User\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a check fails, the message is blocked, redacted, or masked before continuing — the LLM may never see the offending content at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand what threats RAI guardrails protect against\n",
    "2. Create policies with toxicity, NSFW, PII, and topic filters\n",
    "3. Attach and detach policies from agents\n",
    "4. Test guardrails in action with real messages\n",
    "5. Understand the streaming constraint when RAI is active"

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RAI is bidirectional** — it inspects both incoming user messages (input) and outgoing LLM responses (output), providing a complete safety envelope around your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Policies are reusable** — create one policy and attach it to multiple agents. Update it once to change behavior everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Streaming is incompatible with RAI** — RAI requires the complete content to perform its checks. Never use `stream=True` on an agent with an active RAI policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comprehensive policies are preferred** — combine all your checks into a single policy rather than managing multiple partial policies.\n",
    "\n",
